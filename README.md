# IREE LLVM Sandbox

DISCLAIMER: This is not an officially-supported Google project. It is a sandbox
for quick iteration and experimentation on projects related to the IREE project,
MLIR, and LLVM.

This repository contains experimental work by the IREE team closely related to
LLVM and MLIR, usually with the aim of upstreaming in some form. The main
project is at https://github.com/google/iree.

As an experimental project, build greenness, documentation, and polish are
likely to be minimal, as it instead prioritizes easy experimentation.
